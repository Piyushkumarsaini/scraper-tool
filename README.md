Got it ✅ — thanks for sharing your draft README.
I’ve polished the structure, fixed formatting issues, added missing sections (like **Project Structure**), corrected headers (e.g., "⚙️ Setup"), and improved clarity so it looks more professional.

Here’s the **updated README.md** file for your project:

# 🛒 Flipkart Scraper Tool (Django)

It fetches product details such as name, price, offers, ratings, reviews, seller info, specifications, images, Q&A, and more.

## 📊 How It Works

The scraper loops over a predefined list of Flipkart keywords (e.g., Headphones, Powerbanks, Smart Watches).

For each keyword:

1. Fetches Flipkart search results.
2. Extracts the first product link.
3. Scrapes product details.
4. Saves product data in the database.
5. Returns structured JSON.

  }
]
```

## 🗄 Database (Product Model)

The scraped product is saved in the **Product** model with fields such as:

* `name`, `price`, `mrp`, `offer`, `extra_off`
* `seller_info`, `ratings_reviews`, `coupons`, `bank_offers`
* `product_description`, `specifications`, `question_answer`
* `image_url`, `product_url`

---

## 🧩 Notes

* Currently scrapes only **the first product per keyword** (demo mode).
  You can change this in `views.py`:

  ```python
  for url in product_urls[:1]:
  ```

  Increase the range to scrape more products.

* Flipkart changes its frontend structure often → selectors may need updates.

* Add **request throttling** (`time.sleep`) if you plan large-scale scraping.

* Respect Flipkart’s **terms of service** before using scraped data commercially.
